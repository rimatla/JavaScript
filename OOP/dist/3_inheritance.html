    <p>Inheritance is when a Object inherit all the properties methods of its parent Object. In order to become a specialized version of the parent Object.</p>
    <p>In JS we use a prototype property to establish sub-classes that will inherent the characteristics of their main parent Class.</p>
    <p>It is very easy to domain.</p>
    <p>So this results in a specialized sub-class that can retain its own property and methods as well as inherit all of the properties methods of the parent class.</p>
