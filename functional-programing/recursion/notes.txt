- Recursion is when a function calls it self until it doesn't
- It will call it self repeatedly until it arrives at a result.
- It's favored in Functional Programing for constructing code that doesn't require setting/maintaining state with local variables.
- Recursive Functions are easier to test, because they are written on a pure manner, producing no side effects.
