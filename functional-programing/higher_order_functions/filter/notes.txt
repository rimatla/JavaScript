- Why Functional Programing?
Less bugs
Easier ro reason about
Less time
Code Re-usability

- Higher Order Functions
Functions are values, that can be passed into other functions
Good for composition
Little programs
input - output

- Ex:
Filter is a function that accepts another function as its argument, returning a new FILTERED version on an array
